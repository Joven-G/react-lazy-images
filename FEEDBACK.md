# Feedback
If you have input on any of these goals or questions (and anything along these lines), drop a line as a Github issue with the 'feedback' label.
I would be glad to discuss these with you.

## Goals
In making this library, I had a number of design goals.
I think they offer valuable context for any input you might have.

- Keep the API surface minimal; provide configuration for the loading behaviour, but defer as much of the rendering as possible to the consumer
- Make the state management in the components explicit and declarative
- Provide auxiliary documentation for presentational patterns

## Questions
Here are some things I am wondering about that you might be able to help with:
- Is the goal of the library apparent?
- Do you think that the interface supports the goal of the library?
- Were you able to figure out placeholder strategies? Are there things we could provide as examples?
- Did you find the examples easy to navigate?
