## Features:
- Composable pieces that range from the simple use case, to preloading images and more
- Modern, performant implementation, using [IntersectionObserver]() and providing fallback strategies
- Eager loading / Server-side rendering support
- Easy to understand source code. You should be able to fork and do your thing if desired.

What it does not do by itself:
- Polyfill `IntersectionObserver`. Adding polyfills is something you should do consciously at the application level, especially if they might incur download and performance costs. See [Polyfilling IntersectionObserver](#polyfill) for different strategies.
- Dictate the kind of placeholders. There are many ways to do that; you can use a simple box with a background color (I hear gray is popular), a blurred image, some gradient or anything you'd like. You are in control of the element that gets rendered.
- Animate the transitions. Again, you are in control of the containers, so it is possible to implement those at the consumer.
- Any kind of intrinsic ratios. Those are better served by another library/styles composed with this one.

In other words, this library focuses on loading the images once in view and supporting loading patterns around that. The actual components are yours to decide!

## Install
This package is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

```shell
$ npm install --save react-lazy-images
# or
$ yarn add react-lazy-images
```

Then import according to your modules model and bundler, such as [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/):

```js
// ES Modules
// For all possible functions to import look at the documentation
import { LazyImage } from 'react-lazy-images';

/// CommonJS modules
const {LazyImage} = require('react-lazy-images');
```

A [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) version is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-lazy-images/dist/react-lazy-images.umd.js"></script>

```

## Motivation
Browsers preload images; as soon as they encounter an `<img>` tag with a valid `src`, they kick off the request for the image (they even do this before the HTML has been parsed).
Even in cases where a certain image is not in the viewport, it will be requested.
This can have adverse effects for users, especially on mobile or metered connections.

This brings us to the basic premise of any Lazy Image Loading library:
- Have a way to observe the visibility of the DOM elements
- Prevent the browser from loading images directly
- Once an image is in view, instruct the browser to load it and place it in the element

In the past, this has meant "hiding" the actual `src` in a `data-src` attribute, and using classes to indicate state, e.g. `.isLazyLoaded .lazyLoad`.
On initialisation, a script would query for these classes and attributes, keep track of visibily, and swap `data-src` with an actual `src`, kicking off the browser request process.
It could even elect to preload the Image, and only swap once loaded.

With React, all this implicit state management is made simpler, since you do not have to stash loading information in the DOM and pick it back up again.
This can potentially mean a nicer, more composable codebase, and it was one of the main design goals for this library.

The way to do this visibility tracking has for the most part been listening for events such as scroll.
This is synchronous by nature and can have performance implications.
This was the motivation for browsers providing [IntersectionObserver]().
Using this API is not specific to React; it just seems like a good fit for this task nowadays.

## Pieces
### `LazyImageBasic`
`LazyImageBasic` is, well, a basic solution. Other components build on a similar interface.
At its core, it is tiny and simple to implement:

```jsx
const LazyImageBasic = ({placeholder, actual}) => (
  <Observer rootMargin="50px 0px" threshold={0.01} triggerOnce>
    {inView => (inView ? actual : placeholder)}
  </Observer>
);
```

It is provided more as a reference, for example if you want to implement something similar, or to investigate whether lazy loading images can fit in your application.
At the moment, it uses [react-intersection-observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer) under the hood, to provide the view monitoring functionality.
There are a few more pieces to it, such as warning about fallbacks and supporting eager loading/rendering.
[Check out the source for LazyImage]('./src/index.js').

### Customising what is displayed
The render prop pattern is used throughout.
The LazyImage component handles the behaviour of tracking when the image is in view, but leaves the actual rendering up to the consumer. Thus, whether you want to display a simple `<img>`, your own `<Image>`, or even wrapped elements, it is simple to do so:

```jsx
<LazyImageBasic
  // This is rendered first
  placeholder={
    <img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/g/60/40" className="w-100" />
  }
  // This is rendered once in view
  actual={
    <img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/g/600/400" className="w-100" />
  }
/>

// Perhaps you want a container?
<LazyImageBasic
  placeholder={
    <div className="LazyImage-Placeholder">
      <img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/g/60/40" className="w-100" />
    </div>
  }
  actual={
    <div className="LazyImage-Actual">
      <img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/g/600/400" className="w-100" />
    </div>
  }
/>
```

### `LazyImage`
A common optimisation to the loading strategy is to preload the image before swapping it for the placeholder.
In other words, once the image is in view, you can kick off a request to load the image, and only swap it once loaded. 
This prevents swapping a half-loaded image (i.e. one that is still scanning top-to-bottom), and allows the transition to be smoother.

The interface is similar to `LazyImageBasic`:
```jsx
// Note that the actual src is also provided separately, 
// so that the image can be requested before rendering
<LazyImage
  src="https://www.fillmurray.com/g/600/400"
  placeholder={
    <img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/g/60/40" className="w-100" />
  }
  actual={
    <img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/g/600/400" className="w-100" />
  }
/>
```

### Eager loading / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
**What does SSR even mean in a lazy images context?**

If you recall the basic premise, then you will know that we "hide" the intended image and display a placeholder.
For the actual image request to kick off, Javascript has to have loaded, and detected that the image is in the viewport.
In cases where you are server-side rendering, there can be a non-neglible amount of time until Javascript is available (i.e. it has to download, parse, execute).
For those cases, it would be beneficial if we can mark images to render with the intended/final src by default, so that the browser can start requesting them as soon as it gets the HTML.

This is a pretty straightforward thing to implement; we just short-circuit the process by using a `loadEagerly` prop:
```jsx
<LazyImage
  loadEagerly
  src="https://www.fillmurray.com/g/600/400"
  placeholder={
    <img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/g/60/40" className="w-100" />
  }
  actual={
    <img src="https://www.fillmurray.com/g/600/400" className="w-100" />
  }
/>
```

While the implementation is simple, the patterns in your app will not necessarily be so.
Think about the cases where it is beneficial to do this, and apply it with intent. Examples might be hero images, the first X elements in a list and so on.
[Some of these use cases are provided as examples](#examples).
